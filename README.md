# ImageOps

This repository contains few java programs which demonstrate Image Processing aspects.
The main class is - "Instush" and there are 4 "Editor" files that each one of them shows a different operation with an image.

Editor 1 - Reads an image and has 3 image operations - flip horizontally, flip vertically, and greyscalying.
Editor 2 - Reads an image and a new size of it and scales it.
Editor 3 - Reads two images and uses the morphing function between them.
(Morphing is an effect which sees one shape or object transform into another in a seamless transition).
Editor 4 - combines the greyscaling and morphing opreations.
